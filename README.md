#   PicoZen
An alternate **AND UNOFFICIAL** library and utility app for PICO XR (and Quest). Designed to look and feel like it came stock.

添加了2D应用分类

修改图标缓存格式和路径为:

Android/data/<packagename>/cache/banners.<packagename>.png

联网库没有的图标可以自制png格式图片的图片生成图标默认尺寸（512x288）


Added 2D application classification

Modify icon cache format and path to  Android/data/<packagename>/cache/banners.<Packagename>.png

Icons that are not available in online libraries can be generated by creating images in PNG format. The default size of the icon is 512x288
